## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

I have wireframes on paper so far. I am planning on making photos of them and add these to my repo.

-   The data structure you plan to use.

I will use a data structure that will work with the provided api. So far I concentrated on getting the functionality of the game working. One that is ready I will start working on implementing the api.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

I will use a table and give each square an unique id.

-   How you plan to approach this project.

I am planning on doing the min requirements first and not to get overwhelmed. Taking it step by step and I will ask for 1-on1 when I am stuck and I will try to get help and help others. I will work in the following order:

1.	Getting the game main features
2.	Implementing the API
3.	Adding some CSS
4.	Attempting bonuses if time allows

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.

1.	I as a user want to be able to sign up and start a game.
2.	As a player I want that my scores are saved when I continue my games on a different day.
3.	I as a user want to have a nice design of the game so that I can enjoy using the game more
4.	As a consumer of a tictactoe game I want the game to respect all common rules.

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.

I will follow the advice of separating concers. I am having a files for html, jquery, js, design (css) and files for using ajax.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project.

I want to make a code tac toe game, but I’m not sure if the time will allow me to do that. So instead of clicking I want to user to use an input field to select their square with css selector. So one can play the game and learn at the same time. This approach is very meta so that I will first do a regular game with jquery click function. But if I manage I will try to do that.

-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.

I will commit often and early, with the use of Git and GitHub. In addition, I will make use of clear commit messages.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses.

For the moment I don’t focus on any bonuses since the project seems very board and complex to me right now.
